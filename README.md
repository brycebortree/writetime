<h3> Philosophy</h3>
<p>If you have a site that makes achieving a hobby easier, you're more likely to do that hobby. If you have mostly personal posts that you can occasionally publicise, you'll begin sharing your writing with others. Get in touch with yourself, establish good habits, and respect your own voice. Writeti.me offers you a space to come in daily and write whatever's on your mind. If you've been especially eloquent, feel free to publicise your post and share with your friends!</p>



<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
<ul>
  <li>SQL</li>
  <li>Express</li>
  <li>AngularJS</li>
  <li>NodeJS</li>
  <li>bcrypt</li>
  <li>ui.router</li>
  <li>express-jwt</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
  <li>Sequelize</li>
</ul>

<h3>Approach Taken</h3>
<p>I started first with working on database schema and settling on a SQL database. I then worked on a simple angular base, which I saved in a new repo for future projects. From there, I was connecting my Express with Angular to pass information to the page, rendering posts, comments, and users together properly, and finally doing some styling.</p>

  gamify
